Dear Reviewer,
I wanted to update you on the progress and my current skill set.

The latest patch with the imported Bootstrap is uploaded on drive with name "bootstrap" and the UI is looking much better compared to previous submission. It’s definitely an improvement.

Currently, I feel most comfortable working with Node.js, Docker, JavaScript, MySQL, Linux and AWS services (such as EC2), as well as the front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. These are the core areas where I can be most productive right from day one.

I am working on strengthening my React skills, and while I am still ramping up, I am confident that within some days after joining techdom, I will be fully capable of handling client projects involving React with confidence. My goal is to become proficient as a full-stack developer, able to manage the entire lifecycle of an application—from initial setup to deployment on the cloud (AWS, EC2, etc.).
